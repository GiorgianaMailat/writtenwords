		<h1>The Elder Statesman, by T. S. Eliot	</h1>
		<h2> What is this self inside us, this silent observer, <br>
		Severe and speechless critic, who can terrorize us<br>
		And urge us on to futile activity, <br>
		And in the end, judge us still more severely <br>
		For the errors into which his own reproaches drove us?<br>
